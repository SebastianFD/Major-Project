# Reflection
    Well things could be worse. I mean it could be better too, but it's going alright I guess.
some things I struggled at though, was the arrays. I was trying to use the arrays for the 
multiple invaders. At first I thought that I'd have to do something with for loops and (.pop), 
(.length), (.shift)... It was very rough and I was stressing out about it and eventually 
calling over Mr. Shellenberg, he suggested that I should use the class system. After showing 
me the basic I got the jist of it and used it and damn it was WAY easier then what I was 
thinking about. 

    Another thing probably would be just the logic of the... Well, almost everything! Programming
